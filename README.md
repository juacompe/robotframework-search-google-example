Robot Framework Example for Searching Scrum Alliance in Google
====

The scenario is as below:

```
    Given I Am At Google Page
    When I Search For Scrum Alliance
    Then I Should See Scrum Alliance Website
```

Note I use [Sublime](http://www.sublimetext.com/) with [robot plugin](https://github.com/shellderp/sublime-robot-plugin) to edit the robot framework specification.
